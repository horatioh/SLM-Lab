        "description": "PyParsing -- A Python Parsing Module\n====================================\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage|\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and\nexecuting simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the\nuse of regular expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library of\nclasses that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in\nPython code.\n\n*[Since first writing this description of pyparsing in late 2003, this\ntechnique for developing parsers has become more widespread, under the\nname Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more information on PEGs*\n`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__\n*.]*\n\nHere is a program to parse ``\"Hello, World!\"`` (or any greeting of the form\n``\"salutation, addressee!\"``):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pyparsing import Word, alphas\n    greet = Word(alphas) + \",\" + Word(alphas) + \"!\"\n    hello = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(hello, \"->\", greet.parseString(hello))\n\nThe program outputs the following::\n\n    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']\n\nThe Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the\nself-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operator\ndefinitions.\n\nThe parsed results returned from ``parseString()`` is a collection of type\n``ParseResults``, which can be accessed as a\nnested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.\n\nThe pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically\nvexing when writing text parsers:\n\n- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle ``\"Hello,World!\"``, ``\"Hello , World !\"``, etc.)\n- quoted strings\n- embedded comments\n\nThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL\nparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-\nfunction algebraic notation parser, among many others.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThere are many examples in the online docstrings of the classes\nand methods in pyparsing. You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. Additional\ndocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online\n`GitHub wiki <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki>`__. An\nentire directory of examples can be found `here <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/tree/master/examples>`__.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT License. See header of the `pyparsing.py <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/blob/master/pyparsing/__init__.py#L1-L23>`__ file.\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nSee `CHANGES <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/blob/master/CHANGES>`__ file.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n.. |Coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/pyparsing/pyparsing/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/pyparsing/pyparsing\n\n"
